# Progress on 2/6/2025
## Phase 1 Task Status
- [x] Install Express Generator TS (via Shopify CLI)
- [x] Generate base project structure (via Shopify CLI)
- [x] Add TypeScript config (via Shopify CLI) 
- [x] Add test directory structure
- [x] Create first passing test
- [x] Add ESLint and Prettier
- [x] Success Criteria: Server returns "Hello World" on / with passing test

## Implementation Notes
- Used Shopify CLI with Remix template instead of Express
- Test structure follows convention: tests/{unit,integration}/{components,models,routes,utils}
- Vitest + JSDOM for testing instead of Jest

## Skipped Tasks
- [ ] Configure Husky for pre-commit hooks

## Emergent Tasks
- [ ] Upgrade ESLint to 9.x
- [ ] Add Prisma linting
- [ ] Add TypeScript path aliases
- [ ] Configure import sorting

# Progress on 2/6/2025

## Phase 1 Task Status
- [x] Upgraded ESLint & configured rules
- [x] Added Prisma linting
- [x] Added TypeScript path aliases (already configured via vite-tsconfig-paths)
- [x] Configured import sorting
- [x] Install Express Generator TS (via Shopify CLI)
- [x] Generate base project structure (via Shopify CLI)
- [x] Add TypeScript config (via Shopify CLI) 
- [x] Add test directory structure
- [x] Create first passing test
- [x] Add ESLint and Prettier
- [x] Success Criteria: Server returns "Hello World" on / with passing test

## Implementation Notes
- Kept ESLint 8.x due to Remix compatibility
- Used recommended Prisma ESLint rules
- Import sorting uses simple-import-sort with default rules
- Used Shopify CLI with Remix template instead of Express
- Test structure follows convention: tests/{unit,integration}/{components,models,routes,utils}
- Vitest + JSDOM for testing instead of Jest

## Skipped Tasks
- [ ] Husky pre-commit hooks (optional for now)

- Using Vitest + JSDOM for testing
- Added setup.ts for test environment configuration
- Configured separate test database environment
- Added PartnerStore model integration test

## Skipped Tasks
None - all planned tasks were completed

## Emergent Tasks
- [ ] Add model validations
- [ ] Add database seed data
- [ ] Configure test database cleanup
- [ ] Add model factories for testing

## Likely Next Steps
- Begin Queue Setup with Redis and Bull
- Project Initialization and Database Setup are complete
- First two sections of Phase 1 are done

# Progress on 2/7/2025

## Phase 1 Task Status - Queue Setup
- [x] Install Redis locally (already installed via homebrew)
- [x] Add BullMQ with TypeScript (used instead of Bull)
- [x] Create sample producer/consumer
- [x] Write test that enqueues/processes job
- [x] Success Criteria: Job processed and logged

## Implementation Notes
- Used BullMQ instead of Bull for better TypeScript support
- Implemented queue naming strategy matching PostgreSQL convention (e.g. order_sync_test)
- Created separate queue infrastructure in app/services/queue following project structure
- Added proper TypeScript types for jobs and results
- Implemented proper test isolation with queue cleanup
- Added error handling and validation in job processing

## Skipped Tasks
None - all planned tasks were completed

## Emergent Tasks

- [ ] Configure queue retry strategies
- [ ] Add queue metrics/logging
- [ ] Configure worker error handling strategies
- [ ] Add queue cleanup policies

## Likely Next Steps
- Phase 1 is complete (all tasks finished or skipped)
- Ready to move to Phase 2: Development Environment
- Next tasks involve Render setup and development store configuration

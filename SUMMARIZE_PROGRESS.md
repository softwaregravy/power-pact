Please review the PROGRESS.md file and create a consolidated summary of all progress so far. Format the output as a new PROGRESS.md file that:

1. Lists completed tasks with [x] checkboxes. 
2. Lists incomplete tasks with [ ] checkboxes 
3. Preserves all implementation notes, grouped by completion date
4. Maintains skipped and emergent tasks sections
5. Updates the "Likely Next Steps" section based on the latest entries
6. Removes duplicate task entries
7. Orders tasks chronologically by completion date
8. Uses raw GitHub-flavored markdown formatting

The output should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Progress Summary as of [LATEST_DATE]

## Completed Tasks
[List all completed tasks with dates]

## Implementation Notes
[Group by date, newest first]

## Skipped Tasks
[List all skipped tasks]

## Emergent Tasks
[List all emergent tasks]

## Likely Next Steps
[Latest "Likely Next Steps" section]
```

Please update the content of PROGRESS.md with this new consolidated format.

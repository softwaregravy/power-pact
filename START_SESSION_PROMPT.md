Review PRD, PLAN, PROGRESS and my zshrc file.

When unsure, ask me questions about what technology we will use. Do not make assumptions. 

Our goal is to make incremental progress on our PLAN. 

First, remind me to update PROGRESS and package files in the project.

Wait for confirmation from the USER that PROGRESS and package are current

Second, review the PROGRESS file again and determine which phase of the project we are working on. 
We are working on a phase if all tasks from previous phases have been completed or skipped, and there are unfinished tasks in the next phase. 
For example, only if all tasks in phase 1 have been completed or are marked as skipped do we move on to phase 2. 
Announce which phase we are working on, and show all the tasks for that phase from the PLAN. 
Keep the tasks identical. 
Connfirm we'd like to work on the phase.

Third, suggest the next step to work on. 
The user will accept or suggest a different step.

Proceed to complete the task

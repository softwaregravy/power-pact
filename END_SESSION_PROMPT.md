Lets wrap up our tasks for now.

I'd like you to make a summary of what we accomplished. Put this in markdown, and put todays date at the top as "date accomplished".  

In the summary, you will answer: 
1. Which tasks did we complete from our PLAN? 
Keep the tasks in PLAN identical. 
You must not change the tasks. 
Tasks are complete if we actually completed them or they are no longer needed due to other steps we have taken. If a step is deemed unnecessary, it is completed. 

2. Do we need to add anything more to our current phase? If we need to add more tasks to our PLAN, we should label them as emergent tasks.

3. Below the list of completed tasks, we can add comments. If we did something different, such as "set up test directory structure".

Here is an example of a summary, follow this format:

```markdown
# Progress on 2/6/2025
## Phase 1 Task Status
- [x] Install Express Generator TS (via Shopify CLI)
- [x] Generate base project structure (via Shopify CLI)
- [x] Add TypeScript config (via Shopify CLI)
- [x] Add test directory structure
- [x] Create first passing test
- [x] Add ESLint and Prettier
- [x] Success Criteria: Server returns "Hello World" on / with passing test

## Implementation Notes
- Used Shopify CLI with Remix template instead of Express
- Test structure follows convention: tests/{unit,integration}/{components,models,routes,utils}
- Vitest + JSDOM for testing instead of Jest

## Skipped Tasks
- [ ] Configure Husky for pre-commit hooks

## Emergent Tasks
- [ ] Upgrade ESLint to 9.x
- [ ] Add Prisma linting
- [ ] Add TypeScript path aliases
- [ ] Configure import sorting
```
